# Heart-Failure-Prediction

This project is based on some libararies such as: numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib and sklearn etc

Since it is the classfication problem where we need to define whether the patient has heart disease or not based on some features which we will be entered by the user.

At first we analyzed our project by building the suitable charts such as: pie chart, histogram etc
Then we try to analyze that which features need to be rectified such as: outliers etc
Thirdly we select those features which were very important in determining the disease and after that we build and trained our model and after that analyzed our results which were as follows:

MAE: 0.1
MSE: 0.1
RMSE: 0.31622776601683794
R_square score:  0.48863636363636354
